## Usage
Once the program is installed, it can be used by typing `node index.js` into the console. A list of options will then appear. This list can be scrolled through with the arrow keys and an option can be selected with the enter key. Depending on the selection, the user may either be shown some data from the database or guided through some additional questions to add some more data to the database. The user can arrow to the “Edit” option when they want to close the program.
